This repository is a project I completed to learn more about the development and deployment of REST API functionality using .NET. 
The project utilizes Docker and MongoDB to provide persistent database record storage. 
This repository follows the tutorial series published by Julio Casal, and covers common .NET development concepts such as:
  - Building entities, in memory prototype repositories, and controllers
  - Dependency injection, data transfer objects (DTOs)
  - Implementing POST, GET, PUT, DELETE functionality in REST API
  - Persisting entities with MongoDB / Docker
  - Tasks, Async, Await functionality
  - Health Checks
  - Creating, pushing, pulling and managing Docker images
  - Kubernetes - initiating clusters, managing .yaml files, scaling pods, logging
  - Unit Testing and TDD - the Arrange / Act / Assert pattern, using Moq, xUnit, and FluentAssertions
